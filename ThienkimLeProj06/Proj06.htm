<h2>Read The Instructions Carefully</h2>
</center>

<p>A detailed set of instructions is provided in a separate document titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments </strong> that you can
view at the Orientation link in your Blackboard course.</p>
<p>I recommend that you study those instructions <strong>very carefully</strong> 
and&nbsp; make yourself a checklist to ensure that you meet all of the 
requirements before submitting your assignment.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the instructions to the letter usually results in a
failing grade, normally zero. The general instructions in that document apply
to this assignment. In addition, this document provides specific
instructions for the assignment. </p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding instructions, please ask them at least
one week prior to the assignment deadline. Don't end up with a bad grade due to the
fact that you didn't understand the instructions. </p>

<p>Every semester there are one or two students who are surprised and saddened
to learn that I really do mean that you must follow the instructions and meet
the specifications exactly or you won't get credit for the assignment. Don't be
one of those students.</p>

<h2>Typographical Errors</h2>
</center>
If you discover any typographical errors in this document, please let me know
so that I can correct the error and notify all of the students.<h2 class="auto-style1" >Source Code and Class Files</h2>

<p>You will find a source code file for the driver class (named Proj06.java) for the program 
in the same zip file from which you extracted this project specification.</p>

<p>Software version requirements are specified in the syllabus for this course.</p>
